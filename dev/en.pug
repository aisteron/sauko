						h3 Hello my dear tourist!
						p My name is Inna, I’m 22 and work as a tour guide. I’ve graduated from the historical faculty, BSU, with a major in cultural heritage and tourism.
						p Even at school I liked travelling around Belarus. As part of school tours we visited different towns every year. In my 8th year when on tour around Brest I was observing our tour guide and visualizing myself as a real expert in this sphere and an arranger of some trips. From that moment I made a decision to become a tour guide and started taking steps towards my goal. Since it turned out to be a life-long process that’s why every tour helps me grow professionally and advance my skills, to learn something new and of course meet and communicate with interesting people. It’s great!
						p I would be more than happy to arrange a tour for you and your relatives and friends around Belarus! I’m also pleased to offer a customized tour that will include accommodation, meal option, visits of museums, waterpark, theatres, agro-country seats.
						p.green I will be glad to see you in Belarus! See you soon in Belarus!
